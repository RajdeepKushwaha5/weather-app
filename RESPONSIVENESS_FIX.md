# Responsiveness Issues & Fixes

## üîç Issues Identified

### **Critical Issues**

1. **Weather Card Fixed Height**
   - `.weather-component__card` has `height: 500px` which causes overflow on mobile
   - Content gets cut off on smaller screens

2. **Grid Items Not Fully Responsive**
   - `.grid-item` has `min-width: 140px` which can cause horizontal scroll
   - Grid doesn't adapt well to very small screens (< 375px)

3. **Search Bar Width Issues**
   - Search bar is `width: 70%` which is too narrow on mobile
   - Button container doesn't stack properly on small screens

4. **Map Height Fixed**
   - `#weather-map` has fixed `height: 360px` which is too tall for mobile

5. **Typography Not Responsive**
   - Font sizes don't scale down on mobile
   - Temperature display (`font-size: 3.8rem`) is too large on small screens

6. **Weather Alerts Positioning**

   - `max-width: 300px` on desktop, `250px` on mobile still too wide

7. **Logo and Navigation**
   - Logo and title don't scale properly
   - Temperature toggle button overlaps on very small screens

8. **Footer Height**
